# Milestone 3: AMASS Human Motion Representation Pipeline for Humanoid Intelligence


## Overview

This milestone develops a complete human motion representation pipeline using the **AMASS human motion dataset** and the **SMPL-X parametric human body model**.

The objective of this stage is to transform raw human motion capture sequences into structured physical representations suitable for future humanoid learning systems.

Instead of directly learning from raw motion trajectories, this pipeline extracts meaningful representations including:

- 3D human body reconstruction
- Joint-based motion representation
- Temporal motion dynamics
- Kinematic features

These representations provide the foundation for future **Motion Encoder**, **latent objective discovery**, and **humanoid intelligence learning**.

# Dataset


This pipeline processes motion capture sequences from the AMASS dataset.

Currently included datasets:


```
AMASS/

├── ACCAD
├── BMLmovi
├── BMLrub
├── CMU
├── DanceDB
├── GRAB
├── HumanEva
├── KIT
└── MPI_HDM05
```


Each AMASS motion file contains:


- Pose parameters
- Body shape parameters (betas)
- Motion capture frequency
- Global body information


Example:


```
poses:

(3955,156)


betas:

(16,)


mocap_framerate:

120 Hz
```


Input example:

# SMPL-X Human Body Reconstruction


The AMASS pose parameters are converted into a full 3D human representation using the SMPL-X body model.


The SMPL-X forward process generates:

- Human body mesh
- Anatomical joints
- 3D kinematic structure


Example reconstruction:


![SMPL-X Reconstruction](media/screenshots/02_smplx_reconstruction.png)



Generated output:


```
Vertices:

(3955,10475,3)


Joints:

(3955,127,3)
```


This validates that human motion capture data can be reconstructed into a physically meaningful 3D human representation.



---

# 3D Joint Motion Representation


After SMPL-X reconstruction, human motion is represented using 3D joint trajectories.


![Joint Representation](media/screenshots/03_joint_representation.png)



The extracted representation contains:


```
127 Human Joints


Position:

(x,y,z)


Temporal Dynamics:

Frame-to-frame motion
```


This representation is more suitable for learning algorithms compared with raw pose parameters because it explicitly describes human kinematics.



---

# Motion Feature Extraction


Temporal motion features are extracted from the reconstructed joint sequences.


Generated features:


```
joints

velocity

acceleration

energy
```


Feature visualization:


![Motion Features](media/screenshots/04_motion_features.png)



## Joint Velocity

Measures the movement of each joint over time.


## Joint Acceleration

Captures changes in motion dynamics.


## Motion Energy

Represents the overall intensity of human movement.



These features provide a compact physical description of human motion dynamics for future representation learning.
